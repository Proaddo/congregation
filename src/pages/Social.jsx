            This prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled in Jesus, and it beckons us to embrace our mission mandate to continue His mission on earth. The Servant of God, Mgr RFC Mascarenhas the Founder, was inspired by this mission mandate of Jesus and the birth of Bethany is an eloquent testimony of his response to this divine call.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700">
            Founder's passion for mission and compassion for the people transformed many lives. He brought the Good News to the poor, through his missionary activities and set an example for us the Bethany Sisters, to champion the cause of those on the fringes of the society, very specially the girl children and women. He gave us an impetus to search for the faceless, voiceless and powerless.

                This verse from Isaiah re-echoed in Jesus, reminds us today that our mission is a continuation of Jesus' mission on earth. Jesus calls us not only to come to him but to go for him.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                Founder's sense of mission transformed many lives. He brought the Good News not only to the poor in his parish but he also set an example for us, the Bethany sisters. He wants us to champion the cause of the poor.

                The Founder, founding members, and the sisters of yester years are indeed the living Gospels of Christ, who have championed the cause of those on the fringes of the society discarded, valueless and powerless.
